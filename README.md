# Portfolio
>### A place to showcase my work as a developer <br><br>
>  I've revamped my react portfolio about a dozen times at this point. While this one is still under construction, It is my favorite version by far. I was able to utilize and learn a few new frameworks that I previously had not been exposed to or comfortable with using. UI design is not typically my strong suit, but for this I really had a vision of what I wanted it to look like, and feel that I was able to capture that vision pretty well. I utilized Tailind CSS to design the front end and to incorporate light/dark mode functionality, and was able to incorporate an interactive background effect with Particlesjs. Because Heroku has become so expensive and non-learner friendly, I explored a new way of deployment with Render. <br><br>
